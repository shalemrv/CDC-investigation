## Debezium and RabbitMQ - Without Kafka 

To configure Debezium with RabbitMQ as a sink, you will use the Debezium RabbitMQ Sink Connector, which allows you to consume change events from Debezium and publish them to a RabbitMQ message broker. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set up this configuration:

**Prerequisites:**

1. A running Debezium instance capturing change events, often from a database.
2. A RabbitMQ message broker instance already set up and running.

**Steps:**

1. **Download and Install the Debezium RabbitMQ Sink Connector:**

   - First, you need to download and install the Debezium RabbitMQ Sink Connector. You can find this connector on the official Debezium website or Confluent Hub, which is a repository for connectors and extensions.

2. **Configure the RabbitMQ Sink Connector:**

   - Create a JSON configuration file for the RabbitMQ Sink Connector. This file specifies the connection details to your RabbitMQ server, the exchange or queue to which the change events will be published, and other settings. Below is a simplified example of a RabbitMQ Sink Connector configuration:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "rabbitmq-sink-connector",
     "config": {
       "connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.rabbitmq.RabbitMQSinkConnector",
       "tasks.max": "1",
       "rabbitmq.host": "your-rabbitmq-host",
       "rabbitmq.port": "your-rabbitmq-port",
       "rabbitmq.virtual.host": "your-virtual-host",
       "rabbitmq.user": "your-username",
       "rabbitmq.password": "your-password",
       "rabbitmq.exchange": "your-exchange",
       "transforms": "unwrap",
       "transforms.unwrap.type": "io.debezium.transforms.UnwrapFromEnvelope",
       "topics": "your-debezium-topic"
     }
   }
   ```

   Modify the settings to match your RabbitMQ environment and requirements.

3. **Start the RabbitMQ Sink Connector:**

   - Start the RabbitMQ Sink Connector using the configuration file you created. You can run it in standalone mode or deploy it in a distributed configuration with Apache Kafka Connect, depending on your setup.

4. **Consume Change Events from RabbitMQ:**

   - The RabbitMQ Sink Connector will consume change events from the specified Debezium topics, unwrap them from the Debezium envelope, and publish them to RabbitMQ. You can now use RabbitMQ consumers to consume these events from RabbitMQ queues and process them as needed.

5. **Implement RabbitMQ Consumers:**

   - Build RabbitMQ consumer applications or use RabbitMQ client libraries to consume the change events published to RabbitMQ. These consumers can process the captured data changes and perform actions based on the events.

6. **Error Handling and Monitoring**:

   - Implement error handling and monitoring to ensure reliable message delivery to RabbitMQ and to track the status and performance of data transfer.

This configuration allows you to use Debezium to capture database changes, publish them to RabbitMQ via the RabbitMQ Sink Connector, and consume the data changes from RabbitMQ as needed.

Please note that the specific configuration may vary based on your environment, and you should refer to the official Debezium RabbitMQ Sink Connector documentation for detailed guidance and advanced configurations.

---

This method described for configuring Debezium with RabbitMQ as a sink does not use Apache Kafka in the data flow.

Instead, it bypasses Kafka entirely and directly sends the captured change events to RabbitMQ.

In this configuration:

1. Debezium captures change events from the source (e.g., a database) and publishes them to RabbitMQ using the RabbitMQ Sink Connector.

2. The RabbitMQ Sink Connector forwards these change events to RabbitMQ as messages without passing through Kafka.

3. RabbitMQ becomes the intermediary message broker where the change events are stored and from where consumers can subscribe to process the data changes.

This method eliminates the need for Kafka as an intermediate data stream between Debezium and RabbitMQ. It's a suitable approach for organizations that prefer or exclusively use RabbitMQ as their message broker and do not want to introduce Kafka into their architecture.
